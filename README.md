# Plan

Implement various algorithms and data structures in various languages starting with a description.

1. Choose a language to work in.
2. Write some pseudocode to represent the problem.
3. Write some tests.
4. Write some code. Go back to 3 if necessary.
5. Keep original code and re-factor to make it better or just to do it another way at least once.
6. Go to next problem and go back to 2.
7. Once all problems are done, go to 1.

## The problems

The problems are a mix of generic problems as well as more specific ones from various sources.

They are located here - [readme.md](https://github.com/msmithnova/playground/blob/master/problems.md)

## Language Choice

There are many choices from C++, Java, Ruby and Python to JavaScript and a multitude of other languages.

For me, Python or JavaScript would likely be easiest since I have done more in those languages more recently and I find them to be easier to work with in general. C language is the one I have used least recently although I used to use it quite a bit. I chose to start with C++. You would think that algorithms are hard enough without choosing a language I'm not currently as familiar with, that is generally less forgiving to begin with and one that I have not written much testing in. Well, you would probably be right. However, I have done many of these problems before although it has been quite some time for many of them as well. Thus, with the exception of testing and some of the harder problems it is more of a review and will make things interesting. I have not used Microsoft Unit Testing previously and chose to use it for the C++ testing just for fun. I guess we'll see how that goes. Anyway, time to get to it.
