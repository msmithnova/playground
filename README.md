# Plan

Implement various algorithms and data structures in various languages starting with a description.

1. Choose a language to work in.
2. Write some pseudocode to represent the problem.
3. Write some tests.
4. Write some code. Go back to 3 if necessary.
5. Keep original code and re-factor to make it better or just to do it another way at least once.
6. Go to next problem and go back to 2.
7. Once all problems are done, go to 1.
